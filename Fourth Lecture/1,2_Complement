Binary Number System is one the type of most popular Number Representation techniques that used in digital systems.
In the Binary System, there are only two symbols or possible digit values, i.e., 0 (off) and 1 (on).
Represented by any device that only 2 operating states or possible conditions.
Generally, there are two types of complement of Binary number: 1’s complement and 2’s complement.
To get 1’s complement of a binary number, simply invert the given number. For example, 1’s complement of binary number 110010 is 001101.
To get 2’s complement of binary number is 1’s complement of given number plus 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).
For example 2’s complement of binary number 10010 is (01101) + 1 = 01110.

Example-1:  Find 1’s complement of binary number 10101110.

Simply invert each bit of given binary number, so 1’s complement of given number will be 01010001.

Example-2:  Find 1’s complement of binary number 10001.001.

Simply invert each bit of given binary number, so 1’s complement of given number will be 01110.110.

2-Compelent

Example-1 − Find 2’s complement of binary number 10101110.

Simply invert each bit of given binary number, which will be 01010001. Then add 1 to the LSB of this result, i.e., 01010001+1=01010010 which is answer.

Example-2 − Find 2’s complement of binary number 10001.001.

Simply invert each bit of given binary number, which will be 01110.110 Then add 1 to the LSB of this result, i.e., 01110.110+1=01110.111 which is answer.
