if in C++
The if statement is the most simple decision-making statement.
It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e
if a certain condition is true then a block of statements is executed otherwise not.

Syntax of if Statement:
if(condition) 
{
   // Statements to execute if
   // condition is true
}

Example:
// C++ program to illustrate If statement 
	
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 	
int main() { 
	int i = 10; 
	
	if (i < 15) { 
		cout << "10 is less than 15 \n"; 
	} 
	cout << "I am Not in if"; 
}

Output:
10 is less than 15 
I am Not in if

Explanation:

Program starts.
i is initialized to 10.
if-condition is checked. 10 < 15, yields true.
“10 is less than 15” gets printed.
if condition yields false. “I am Not in if” is printed.



C++ if else Statement
Decision Making in C++ helps to write decision-driven statements and execute a particular set of code based on certain conditions.

if (condition)
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is true
}
else
{
    // Executes this block if
    // condition is false
}

Example 1:
Below program demonstrates the use of if else statements in C++.


// C++ program to illustrate if-else statement  
    
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
    
int main()  
{  
    int i = 20;  
    
    // Check if i is 10  
    if (i == 10)  
        cout << "i is 10";  
    
    // Since is not 10  
    // Then execute the else statement  
    else
        cout << "i is 20\n";  
    
    cout << "Outside if-else block";  
    
    return 0;  
}  

C++ if else if Ladder
Decision-making in C++ helps to write decision-driven statements and execute a particular set of code based on certain conditions.

Syntax
if (condition)
    statement 1;
else if (condition)
    statement 2;
.
.
else
    statement;

Example 1:
Below program illustrates the use if else if ladder in C++.

// C++ program to illustrate if-else-if ladder  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
    
int main()  
{  
    int i = 20;  
    
    // Check if i is 10  
    if (i == 10)  
        cout << "i is 10";  
    
    // Since i is not 10  
    // Check if i is 15  
    else if (i == 15)  
        cout << "i is 15";  
    
    // Since i is not 15  
    // Check if i is 20  
    else if (i == 20)  
        cout << "i is 20";  
    
    // If none of the above conditions is true  
    // Then execute the else statement  
    else
        cout << "i is not present";  
    
    return 0;  
}
