## Ternary or Conditional Operators(?:) ##

This operator returns the value based on the condition. 
Expression1? Expression2: Expression3

The ternary operator ? determines the answer on the basis of the evaluation of Expression1.
If it is true, then Expression2 gets evaluated and is used as the answer for the expression.
If Expression1 is false, then Expression3 gets evaluated and is used as the answer for the expression.

This operator takes three operands, therefore it is known as a Ternary Operator. 

Example 1:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a = 3, b = 4;
    // Conditional Operator
    int result = (a < b) ? b : a;
    cout << "The greatest number is " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}


Example 2:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a = 1;
    // Conditional Operator
    cout << (a > 0) ? "P" : ((a == 0) ? "Z" : "N");
    return 0;
}
