# Arithmetic Operators
in C++ are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations on the operands.
For example, ‘+’ is used for addition, ‘–‘ is used for subtraction,  ‘*’ is used for multiplication, etc. 
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data; they follow the same relationship between an operator and an operand.

** Example: **

// C++ program to execute all 5 
// arithmetic function 
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
int main() { 
    int x = 10, y = 3; 
    // printing the sum of x and y 
    cout<< "x + y= " << (x + y) << endl; 
  
    // printing the difference of x and y 
    cout << "x - y = " << (x - y) << endl; 
  
    // printing the product of x and y 
    cout << "x * y = " << (x * y) << endl; 
  
    // printing the division of x by y 
    cout << "x / y = " << (x / y) << endl; 
  
    // printing the modulo of x by y 
    cout << "x % y = " << (x % y) << endl; 
  
    return 0; 
}

** Very important rules about (%) **

First:

if   K >= N  then    K % N = {0 , N-1}  
The Remender will never reach to N

Example:
 16 % 4 = 0
 15 % 4 = 3
 14 % 4 = 2
 13 % 4 = 1
 12 % 4 = 0
 11 % 4 = 3
 10 % 4 = 2
 9 % 4 = 1
 8 % 4 = 0


Second:
if   K < N  then    K % N = K

Example:
 9 % 10 = 9
 8 % 4 = 8
 7 % 4 = 7
 6 % 4 = 6
 5 % 4 = 5
