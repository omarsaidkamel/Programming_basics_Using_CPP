In C++, comments are lines of text that are ignored by the compiler.
They are essential for documenting your code, making it easier to understand for yourself and others.
Here are the two main types of comments in C++ with examples:

1. Single-line comments:

    Use two forward slashes (//) to start a single-line comment.
    Everything following the // on that line is ignored by the compiler.

Example

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  // This is a single-line comment explaining the purpose of the next line
  cout << "Hello, world!";
  return 0;
}


2- Multi-line comments:

    Use /* and */ to enclose comments that span multiple lines.
    Anything between these markers is treated as a comment.


Example:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  /* This is a multi-line comment explaining a more complex code block.
     It can span multiple lines and improve readability. */
  std::cout << "This message is printed thanks to the multi-line comment above." << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

Benefits of Using Comments:

Improved Code Readability: Comments clarify the purpose of code sections, making them easier to understand for both the author and anyone else reading the code.This is especially important for complex logic or non-obvious code sections.
    
Code Maintainability: As code evolves over time, comments help developers understand the original intent and logic behind the code. This facilitates maintenance and future modifications.
  Collaboration: Clear comments enhance communication within teams working on the same codebase. They help developers understand each other's work and avoid misunderstandings.
